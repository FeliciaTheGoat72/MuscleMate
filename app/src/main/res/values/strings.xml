    <string name="bench_desc">
        Lie on your back on a flat bench. Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. The bar should be directly over the shoulders.
        Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout the entire movement.
        Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement. Avoid arching your back.
        Slowly lift the bar or dumbbells off the rack, if using. Lower the bar to the chest, about nipple level, allowing elbows to bend out to the side, about 45 degrees away from the body.
        Stop lowering when your elbows are just below the bench. Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position.
        Perform 5 to 10 reps, depending on weight used. Perform up to 3 sets.</string>

    <string name="incline_desc">

        Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
        Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
        Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
        Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
        Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
        Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
        Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
