    <string name="bench_desc">
        Lie on your back on a flat bench. Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. The bar should be directly over the shoulders.

        Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout the entire movement.

        Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement. Avoid arching your back.

        Slowly lift the bar or dumbbells off the rack, if using. Lower the bar to the chest, about nipple level, allowing elbows to bend out to the side, about 45 degrees away from the body.

        Stop lowering when your elbows are just below the bench. Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position.

        Perform 5 to 10 reps, depending on weight used. Perform up to 3 sets.</string>

    <string name="incline_desc">

        Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

        Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

        Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

        Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

        Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

        Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

        Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="flies_desc">
        Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

        To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.

        Slightly retract your shoulder blades, unlock your elbows, and slowly lower the dumbbells laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.

        Once the dumbbells reach chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pecs together and bringing the dumbbells back to their starting position.

        Without allowing the dumbbells to touch, start the next repetition, and continue until the set is completed.

</string>

    <string name="dips_desc">
        Step up on the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip.

        Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor.

        Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="push_ups_desc">
        Assume a quadruped position on the floor with your hands under your shoulders, toes tucked, and knees under hips.

        Extend one leg at a time and assume a pushup position with the legs straight, elbows extended, and head in a neutral position looking at the floor.

        Slowly descend to the floor by retracting the shoulder blades and unlocking the elbows.

        Descend until the upper arms are parallel or your chest touches the floor.

        Push back to the starting point by extending the elbows and driving your palms into the floor.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="bend_over_row_desc">
        Assume a standing position while holding the bar using a double overhand grip.

        Hinge forward until your torso is roughly parallel with the floor (or slightly above) and then begin the movement by driving the elbows behind the body while retracting the shoulder blades.

        Pull the bar towards your belly button until it touches your body and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position under control.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="RDL_desc">
        Position the bar over the top of your shoelaces and assume a hip width stance.

        Assume a double overhand grip just outside of hip width and deadlift the weight into position at the top with the hips and knees locked out.

        Begin the RDL by pushing your hips back and hinging forward until the bar is just below knee height.

        Drive through the whole foot and focus on pushing the floor away.

        Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

</string>
    <string name="pullup_desc">
        Stand beneath the bar and grasp it approximately shoulder-width.

        Tighten your core before beginning. Pull up, focusing on driving your elbows back.

        Continue pulling up with your chest slightly upward and your back slightly arched until your chin / chest reach the bar.

        Descend slowly, feeling the squeeze in your back on the way down. Repeat.

</string>
    <string name="deadlift_desc">
        Stand in front of the bar, bending your knees and sinking your hips down to grab it, keeping your back straight.

        Grip the bar from slightly wider than shoulder width. Sink your hips. Your chest should be upright and back straight.

        Drive your hips back and down in a standing-up motion. Keep your back straight at all times and thrust your hips forward in the top half.

        Lock out at the top, and sink your hips slowly to descend and repeat.

</string>
    <string name="upright_desc">
        Grab the bar slightly more narrow than shoulder width. Pull it to your chin.

        While pulling, keep your elbows above your hands. Squeeze at the top.

        Descend slowly, keeping tension in the traps. Repeat.

</string>
    <string name="db_row_desc">
        For right hand (flip for left): Set the dumbbell in the middle of a bench.

        Place your left knee in front of it and your left hand behind it at a distance that makes your back parallel with the bench.

        Grab the dumbell with your right hand and allow it to hang to the right of the bench.

        Drive your elbow back, pulling the dumbbell to your right oblique. Squeeze your right lat and descend slowly. Repeat.

</string>
    <string name="crunch_desc">
        Lie on your back. Place your hands at your ears and bring your knees toward your chest until they are 90 degrees.

        With your abdomen, pull your upper body toward your knees. Focus on squeezing your abs and keeping your back as straight as possible.

        Bring your back to the ground slowly, feeling the squeeze in your abs.

</string>
    <string name="situp_desc">
        Lie on your back. Place your hands at your ears and bring your feet close to your butt while keeping them flat on the ground.

        With your abdomen, pull your upper body toward your knees. Focus on squeezing your abs and keeping your back as straight as possible.

        Bring your back to the ground slowly, feeling the squeeze in your abs.

</string>
    <string name="plank_desc">
        Lie on your stomach and push yourself up parallel with the ground. Shift your stance from your hands to your elbows.

        Keep your feet together and your back flat. Squeeze your core and hold as long as you can.

</string>
    <string name="rTwist_desc">
        Sit down and hold your feet above the ground with your knees slightly bent. Clasp your hands or a weight

        above your core and rotate to the right, touching the ground to your right while keeping your feet still

        and core tight. Quickly then rotate to the left touching the ground, and repeat.

</string>
    <string name="leg_raise_desc">
        Lie on your back with your legs straight out in front of you. Place your hands at your side, on the ground.

        Keeping your legs straight, raise them to 90 degrees. Squeeze your core the entire time.

        Slowly descend to 6 inches above the ground and repeat.

</string>
    <string name="split_squat_desc">
        Select a dumbbell and position it at chest height with one hand under each edge of the dumbbell.

        Set up in a split stance position with your hands by your side looking straight ahead.

        Descend by flexing both knees simultaneously and continue until the back knee touches the ground directly beneath the hip.

        Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you return to the starting position.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="squat_desc">
        Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.

        Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.

        Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn\'t, try adding some padding to the bar.

        Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.

        You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.

        Keeping your back straight and eyes up, push up through the legs and take the weight off the rack.

        Take a small step back and stabilize yourself.

        Keeping your eyes facing forward slowly lower your body down. Don\'t lean forward as you come down. Your buttocks should come out and drop straight down.

        Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor, and then slowly raise your body back up by pushing through your heels.

        Do not lock the knees out when you stand up, and then repeat the movement.</string>

    <string name="lunge_desc">
        Choose a pair of dumbbells and stand up straight with a slight bend in your knees.

        Hold the dumbbells down at your sides. You are now in the starting position.

        Step forward with your left leg while maintaining your balance and squat down through your hips.

        Keep your torso straight and head up. Don\'t allow your knee to track out over your toes.

        Push yourself back to the starting position by using your heal to drive you.

        Repeat this movement with your right leg and then repeat for desired reps.</string>

    <string name="bridge_desc">
        Start in a supine position on the floor and pull one knee to your chest by interlacing your fingers in front of your knee.

        Bridge your hips up by squeezing your glutes and driving your heels into the floor.

        Lower the leg back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions on both sides.</string>
