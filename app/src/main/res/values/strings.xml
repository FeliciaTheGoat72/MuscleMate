    <string name="bench_desc">
        Lie on your back on a flat bench. Grip a barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder width. The bar should be directly over the shoulders.

        Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout the entire movement.

        Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement. Avoid arching your back.

        Slowly lift the bar or dumbbells off the rack, if using. Lower the bar to the chest, about nipple level, allowing elbows to bend out to the side, about 45 degrees away from the body.

        Stop lowering when your elbows are just below the bench. Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position.

        Perform 5 to 10 reps, depending on weight used. Perform up to 3 sets.</string>

    <string name="incline_desc">

        Lie flat on an incline bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.

        Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.

        Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.

        Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.

        Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.

        Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.

        Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="flies_desc">
        Pick up the dumbbells off the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the ends of the dumbbells in your hip crease, and sit down on the bench.

        To get into position, lay back and keep the weights close to your chest. Once you are in position, take a deep breath, then press the dumbbells to lockout at the top.

        Slightly retract your shoulder blades, unlock your elbows, and slowly lower the dumbbells laterally while maintaining the angle at your elbow.

        Once the dumbbells reach chest level, reverse the movement by squeezing your pecs together and bringing the dumbbells back to their starting position.

        Without allowing the dumbbells to touch, start the next repetition, and continue until the set is completed.

</string>

    <string name="dips_desc">
        Step up on the dip station (if possible) and position your hands with a neutral grip.

        Initiate the dip by unlocking the elbows and slowly lowering the body until the forearms are almost parallel with the floor.

        Control the descent to parallel and then drive back to the starting position by pushing through the palms.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>

    <string name="push_ups_desc">
        Assume a quadruped position on the floor with your hands under your shoulders, toes tucked, and knees under hips.

        Extend one leg at a time and assume a pushup position with the legs straight, elbows extended, and head in a neutral position looking at the floor.

        Slowly descend to the floor by retracting the shoulder blades and unlocking the elbows.

        Descend until the upper arms are parallel or your chest touches the floor.

        Push back to the starting point by extending the elbows and driving your palms into the floor.

        Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</string>
